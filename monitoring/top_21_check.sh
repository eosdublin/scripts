# Usage
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Requirements:
#     Twilio Account
#
# This is a very simple script which checks the producers system table to see
# if a given producer is within the top 21. If so, the script checks for the
# existence of a file, used to indicate whether the producer the producer has
# recently been elected in to the top 21.
#
#   - If the file exists, no further action is taken.
#   - If the file does not exist, it is created and alerts are sent out.
#
# If the given producer name is not present in the top 21, the existence of
# the aforementioned file is checked. The presence of the file indicates the
# producer has been relegated from the top 21.
#
#  - If the file exists, it is deleted and an alert is triggered.
#Â  - If the file does not exist, no further action is taken.
#
# When alerts are sent out, the Twilio REST API is used to trigger either
# a phone call or an SMS, or both.
#
# Alerts
#
# * Producer has been elected to top 21
#    - Phone call
#    - SMS
# * Producer has been relegated from the top 21
#    - SMS
